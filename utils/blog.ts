      "MPs call for student Covid disruption funding in England to be doubled",
    content:
      '<p>A cross-party group of MPs and peers is calling for the government to more than double financial support for university students in <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">England</a> whose education has been disrupted by the pandemic, potentially amounting to £700m.</p> <p>The fund would provide support for <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/20/studying-under-lockdown-how-to-look-after-your-mental-wellbeing" data-link-name="in body link">students experiencing hardship</a> as a result of lost income from term-time jobs in retail and hospitality. It would also cover rent rebates for accommodation that has not been used due to lockdown measures requiring students to remain at the addresses they returned to over the Christmas break.</p> <p>The group further recommended the creation of a new learning remediation fund to cover additional losses from missed teaching, networking, field trips, access to specialist facilities and so on.</p> <p>A report by the group report states: “We believe that the priority is to provide students with the financial assistance that they need now … We feel that this approach is fairer and more effective than any general reduction in tuition fees. We believe that an additional sum more than doubling existing student premium funding, of £256m, would be required. Applying the Welsh approach would suggest a figure around £700m for England.”</p> <p>The report is the result of an inquiry responding to calls for compensation launched by the all-party parliamentary group for students, chaired by the Labour MP Paul Blomfield and involving two Conservative former higher education ministers, David Willetts, the architect of the £9,250 tuition fee system, and the peer Tim Boswell.</p> <p>The inquiry heard from universities, accommodation providers, private landlords, the National Union of <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/students" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Students</a> (NUS), 47 students’ unions and 294 individual students across the UK.</p> <p>Since the pandemic began, the Westminster government has increased student premium funds, which are targeted at those students who need additional financial and educational support, by £20m. However, since the fund was cut by £16m in May 2020, this represents just a £4m real-terms rise.</p> <p>The Westminster government’s support for the 1.95 million students in England has fallen behind that in Scotland and Wales, where education is devolved. Wales, which has 132,200 students, has earmarked <a class="u-underline" href="https://gov.wales/40-million-extra-support-students-facing-financial-hardship" data-link-name="in body link">£80m of funding</a> for student hardship, while Scotland announced on Tuesday it would provide its 253,475 students with an additional £30m of hardship funding on top of an earlier £37m package. Northern Ireland has <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/news/ps56million-available-alleviate-student-hardship-additional-ps14million-announced" data-link-name="in body link">nearly doubled its hardship support package</a> for its 55,755 students to £5.6m.</p> <p>There is <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/06/england-campus-lockdowns-perfect-storm-students-mental-health-covid-restrictions" data-link-name="in body link">growing anger</a> among students who feel that they were lured on to campuses with promises of a conventional experience to shore up university finances. A network of students organising rent strikes at universities across the country estimate that about 25,000 students, or 5% of all those in halls, have withheld or plan to withhold rent payments.</p> <p>Three-quarters of students who responded to <a class="u-underline" href="https://nusdigital.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document/documents/64628/36869658898f3a8796423092a828cdfc/Coronavirus_report_Phase_3_Finance_FINAL_November_2020_for_publication.pdf?X-Amz-Expires=10000&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210128T123021Z&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHMaCWV1LXdlc3QtMSJIMEYCIQC2Vw9mSSVk5pSVVLzIq1pyKVVrK4GJ%2BSqvQ1%2B%2BsRnDMgIhAO26Te2I0WH6wHf8GEt%2FxVnZ9YuZHX0jGNpZnjiB0B6KKsMDCFsQABoMODc5MjI4MzQwMzM4IgyTIg6vejGIlTTxuVAqoAMrNaFDo4Q6C0kJTR%2BduvBm%2FHgWZN78R47v3QitlzjHyyRCO%2BgqgyTrzJGEj0%2FUz0sHxvqxLeuQvDswKDzqU0TbIJVaGVfEE59IBXcM8f45ZpdBo1QShuWQRinPlYHYSmVZkuSEijHL2%2BucLyywnjHscUE6vz8cqTyYgyLS16NlGU9vwdCDbQGEJYZV9ah57oKB2oiDQHMH4nwuRF%2Bbp%2BSpZ%2Bj%2FkBQYbBj%2FKdPbZij5TXu%2BFRi2zPH2uPevA5etlniDvGI2JxxeNdpJGe3pFA0rMohrIHucP3LG9h1I9Rruw3pHiQTcuL9Ksv%2Bc8JT2DXIpp0l%2BpVYORM86YIfF0RSgDrg9E%2Bg%2BRBq5MymLWj7IO%2BHpDX6%2BQHelDfi3%2BO%2FHekd8Nwb9omqFrYog7eYhRZkVefJT5GUdFxtor4i4jpMHjpxbBACsNjN7p0YlK%2FhxFl6iIRSJ2QxjlfR%2BuGm%2B6juCdxpnQ8I8XEV48lVQwT6MRBUDFneNMWPHLRx5jnmNET6cKVE3ab5D%2BMYKzx2IFgQbpuqwo66EFH5nQBRbwkSafDDOoMqABjrqAeyx3b3u1irfEMHKdgkZQCPwIN57nyIJzY%2BR9TYXYrFTGSHvadKwWEIn0MkF%2BQiXPLAeh8hF%2FNarlrHJH%2BSgrj6VzQNE8N4LJ%2Bt1jKbR97VSfjERr2%2FQEkyARVjmhsJ8ES0qv6uLiuVzgLQI4tT6h0btkFXqD%2BSVv9fR7QC%2BXoIKkEeqZD5fAvIE959tFpX9r3ajN4wjwqH1%2BHEvEsOnYyAc5F7jjaFXhWteI8MN9yKloeLj1S%2BAMKEZa7XA3eYAyispMO9JDfTxSwxWubaB%2F2Gj051j7Xl%2Fj%2BInqyjRSAAfsAap7fLEt71TvA%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA4ZNQXZBZF7UMFHNF%2F20210128%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=ca3c8d7e09593a9947feef0e655499bca66b3e1b92cf5628c30393bb81b05fe5" data-link-name="in body link">an NUS survey</a> in November said their finances has suffered due to the pandemic, while over two-thirds of renters said they were worried about covering their rent.</p> <p>There has been a patchy response to compensation across universities.

      "4-year post-study work visa: Is the UK offering this to international students?",
    content:
      "<p>The UK’s former universities minister Jo Johnson has called for the duration of the post-study work visa to be doubled to four years. He reasons this would make the UK a globally attractive destination for students post-COVID-19 and Brexit.</p> <p>In a new report – Universities Open to the World: How to put the bounce back in Global Britain – released on Monday, Johnson also called to double the number of Indian students in UK universities by 2024.</p> <p>The report was prepared by Johnson for the Policy Institute at King’s College London and the Harvard Kennedy School.</p> <p>For much of the last decade, the UK Government has run contradictory policies aimed both at increasing education exports, while simultaneously “managing down international student numbers in a misguided attempt to reduce overall net migration to below 100,000,” according to Johnson.</p> <p>This has created a volatile and unstable policy environment which saw the UK gradually see its share of the international education market slip over the past 10 years, he said.</p> <p>International students are drawn to opportunities to work in the countries they graduate in. Forty percent of international students stated this as one of their top five considerations.</p> <p>“Retaining these high-skilled students is also a major benefit to the UK. A 2018 survey found that three-quarters of British people supported allowing international graduates to work in the UK for a period of time in order to enable them to contribute to the UK economy after their studies,” he said.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Johnson’s call remains a proposal.</p> <p>Previously, former universities minister Chris Skidmore made similar calls for a four-year post-study work visa. Former UK home secretary Sajid Javid also supported plans to make it easier for international students to work in the UK.</p>",

So again, that has to go through all the committee structures.”</p> <p>Other details in the guidance include a note that Tier 4 visa applications can still be made using CAS [Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies unique numbers] that may have expired.</p> <p>“The start date for the course may now be later than that stated on the CAS for the original course or the CAS may have expired. The Home Office will take a pragmatic approach to considering applications to study courses with significantly different start dates to those stated on CAS or expired CAS,” stated the document.</p> <blockquote><p>The start date for the course may now be later than that stated on the CAS for the original course</p></blockquote> <p>In terms of visa extension, students whose leave expires between 24 January 2020 and 31 May 2020, who would otherwise be unable to extend in-country, will be able to exceptionally apply for further leave within the UK.</p> <p>This includes students studying at providers who would otherwise be required to apply from their home country for further leave, such as students at non Higher Education Providers with a track record of compliance.</p> <p>To be granted further leave to complete an existing course, or to begin a new course, students must still meet all other requirements of Tier 4, including academic progression and maintenance requirements.</p> </div> </section>`,

But recently global student mobility has begun to shift,” he wrote in the report.</p> <p>“The UK’s market share declined in 17 out of the world’s 21 top sending countries between 2010 and 2017.</p> <p>“By contrast, Australia has now seen steady year-on-year growth of around 14% and might soon catch up with the UK in terms of total overseas numbers if it has not done so already.”</p> <div id="attachment_138361" class="wp-caption alignnone"> <p><a href="https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00.png" class="broken_link"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-138361 " src="https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00.png" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" srcset="https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00.png 980w, https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00-300x221.png 300w, https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00-768x566.png 768w, https://d1pe6f90ru47yo.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12162257/Screenshot-2020-06-12-at-17.22.00-136x100.png 136w" alt="" width="436" height="321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138361" /></a></p> <p id="caption-attachment-138361" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Universities open to the world report</p> </div> <p>To maintain its foothold as a top student destination, Johnson said that it is vital to send a clear signal that Britain is open and welcome, with a “best-in-class student visa offer”.</p> <p>To achieve this, he said, the government should “turbocharge” the competitiveness of the UK visa offer with the doubling of post-study work visas from two to four years.</p> <p>He also suggested that the UK should seek to re balance its mix of international students coming by doubling Indian student numbers by 2024.</p> <p>Johnson acknowledged that the UK has made strides in appealing to Indian students after a steep decline following the removal of the PSW visa in 2012.</p> <p>The government should take heed of the fact that the number of Tier 4 study visas for Indian students increased 136% to almost 50,000 in the year to March 2020, he counselled.</p> <blockquote><p>“Boris is a strong supporter of international students and always has been”</p></blockquote> <p>He added that reversing the Home Office’s “continued and deeply unpopular” exclusion of India from its low-risk Tier 4 visa list – which allows students from China and certain other countries a streamlined visa process – should also be a priority.</p> <p>“The UK is in a good position to take market share from the US in India and a further improvement in the post-study work offer would help the sector overcome new concerns about studying in the UK that have arisen in the wake of Covid-19,” he said.</p> <p>“A Tier 4 visa that promises four years of post-study work rights will be of huge advantage to the UK in India, where students are particularly sensitive to this opportunity.”</p> <p>Among his other recommendations, Johnson – who was appointed chairman of the advisory board to ApplyBoard in February – also wants to re-focus the British Council on education promotion and build a Study UK alumni network to “leverage its international alumni”.</p> <p>“International education is one of the UK’s few globally competitive sectors,” said Johnson in a statement.</p> <p>“The moment has come to ensure that the UK’s great universities can play their full part in this next chapter of Britain’s engagement with the world beyond its shores.”</p> <p>When asked if the UK was too reliant on China, in an interview with BBC Radio 4, he commented that beyond a focus on India, “I recommend we increase significantly the number of students from other key countries such as Nigeria and Malaysia to re balance the mix<i>.”</i></p> <p>Asked if brother Boris was receptive to Johnson’s agenda, he replied, “<b></b>He’s a strong supporter of international students and always has been<i>.</i></p> <p><b></b>“He’s got the report. He’s received it. And, you know, I’m sure he’ll be getting round to reading it as and when he has a chance.”</p> <p>Laura Rettie, vice president of global communications at education consultancy Studee commented: “Brexit and now the pandemic has been the perfect storm, plunging many [universities] to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>“The government must offer support to keep them afloat – time is of the essence as UK universities slide further down the rankings.”</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of universities in the UK dropped down places in the list of the latest QS World University Rankings.</p> </div> </section> <p>&nbsp;</p>`,
